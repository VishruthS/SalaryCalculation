Calculate Employee Salary. 


Write a Java program to calculate the monthly salary of employees based on their hourly
rate and the number of hours worked. Consider the following:

· Regular hours (up to 40 hours per week) are paid at the regular rate.
· Overtime hours (over 40 hours per week) are paid at 1.5 times the regular rate.
· Deduct 10% for taxes from the total salary.
